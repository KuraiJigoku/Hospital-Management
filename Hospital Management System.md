# Hospital Management System

This project is a comprehensive Hospital Management System built in Python. It is designed to manage various aspects of a hospital's operations, such as patient data, doctor data, and more.

The system connects to a MySQL database using the `mysqlc` and `mysql.connector` modules to store and retrieve data. It also uses the `texttable` module to display formatted tables in the console, providing a user-friendly interface.

Key features of the system include:

- **Patient Module**: This module allows patients to log in to their accounts and view their personal information and doctor details. It includes functions for validating login credentials and displaying patient and doctor data.

- **Admin Module**: This module contains functions for managing a bank's database. It includes functions for logging in as an admin, adding, removing, updating, and displaying doctors and patients in the database.

- **Appointment Bill Module**: This module contains the functions for bills of patients


This Hospital Management System is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with clear prompts and messages for the user. It aims to streamline the management of hospital operations and improve the efficiency of administrative tasks.
